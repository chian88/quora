          Ah yes, this is so actual.

          People are getting more and more advanced in their skillset, solving complicated problems and growing professionally but the learning material is just not there yet. Honestly, I don't think this problem will ever be completely solved, because the amounts of different tech stacks and their combinations is unthinkable. It would take ages and ages to record or write down so many tutorials or books for every single problem one might face.

          As always,The two best techniques to learn advanced things in the programming field and get better stay the same:

          Read a lot of code
          Write a lot of code
